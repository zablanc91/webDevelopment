				<p>
					Comiket is a grassroots, DIY effort for selling doujinshi, self-published Japanese works. This event is held twice a year, once in August, and once in December at the Tokyo Big Sight convention center near Ariake, in Tokyo,Japan.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					For those of us who have been following the Doujin scene for some time, Comiket is probably the most important event in the calendar. It's a place where like minded fans and creators gather to show what they've been working on. Think of it as the Japanese indie scene's E3 or Tokyo Game Show.
